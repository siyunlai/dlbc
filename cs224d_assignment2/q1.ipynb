TensorFlow looks at the operations in the graph to implement the corresponding automatic differentiation (built-in) during the back propagation.  This will alleviate the pain to write common back propagation functions.  However, if one want's to speed up a customized operation, one could implement one's own operation and automatic differentiation pair.  \n"
